Every Journey, They say starts with a step, and yes i have taken a couple of steps and still taking. In the bid to test one really cool new thing i learned, I am feeling inspired to write all about the couple of steps that led me to this point.

The following are the Markup of this story:

- The Infactuation
- Turning Into a Goal
- The Sudden Bump
- Commiting All Over

## The Infactuation

---

It all started when i was in My elementary school, when we were having a discussion with my class teacher about our aspiring career choises. This discsussion led to the part were almost all the boys in the class wanted to be an **Engineer**, and yes I was part of the crowd. This led our teacher to explain further that **engineering** is a field with numerous sub fields. While he was listing the sub fields, one stood out to me and ever since i have been infatuated with gettin more details.

This infatuation led me to seeking a computer science degree, but somethings led to the other and i got a different course while i was seeking a National Diploma in the Federal Polytechnic of Ilaro. Barely into my second year, a friend introduced me to this idea he was seeking after, and it was an amazing idea that i also got myself all sunked in.

## Turning Into a Goal

---

The idea i alluded to above was for me being an Andelan Fellow, which at that time was seeming impossible, as i have little to no backgroud whatsoever in programming. The entry test and the readings seem to encrypted at that time and i could barely decrypt. So I took a chill pill and stayed away for about a year, so i can finish that year in school. Resumed once i was on break to start my internship, this was still not as straight forward as I wanted it to be.

During my internship, I got more motivation to strive towards getting this more than ever, as i made it my next step, as opposed to going back for the remaining two years of the Polytechnic HND. I was so sure of what i wanted during this period, that i sat my Mum down and made her realize i was not interested in going any forther with the HND course. backToHome

## The Sudden Bump

---

This goal was not easy to pursue, as it required i unlearn and relearn some presuppostion/habbits. I also required i embody some core values, both in work and personally. I learned the hard way, by failing so much that i succeeded. This success was a blessing/caurse in disguise. What i man is that i was blesed with the values embodied, and i also got uncomfortable being mediocre. and i am currently reaping the benefits. The course aspect is circumstantial, as i mistakingly took getting into Andela as my ultimate goal, not really giving what lies beyond much thoughts. This was one of the many reasons why i got in and started relaxing and also got really affected by what happened next.

What happended next was really shocking and sudden, as my time at andela was cut short due to some business decision that involves rendering my role and 420 othe colleageus redundant. We got fairly compensated no doubt, but it got me into the most down moments of my life/career. I was practically unmotivated and less the guy i had developed to be. Stopped applying, only taking the safe jobs, felt like a fraud and all the package that comes with being down. I was basically without income for a year, and my coding was really not much.

## Committing All Over

---

This is a really good thing, writting the story as i remember it, and also facing the fact of the fact that i am to be blamed more than any thing. That being said, i believe it was a really great learning experience, as it got me to adopt more than ever the learn-it all mindset, which has the following benefits:

- Not living in fear of failure
- Excellence (constantly improving)
- And so on...

So i would love to finish on the note of commiting to being the guy described with the following qualities:

- Excellent
- Honnest
- Great Collaborator
- Fair

## Conclussion

---

Amongst many other values i would grow to learn and understand, i am commiting to learning more than i did before, and using my learnings to improve, myself, those around me and my community at large. ðŸ˜…
